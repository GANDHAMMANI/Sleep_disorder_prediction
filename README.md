# 💤 Sleep Disorder Prediction

This repository contains the code for a predictive model aimed at detecting sleep disorders using machine learning. The model has been deployed as a live web application using **Streamlit**, enabling users to seamlessly interact with the application and visualize predictions. The project is part of a comprehensive study aimed at improving healthcare outcomes through the early detection of sleep disorders.

## 📝 Project Overview

Sleep disorders, if not detected early, can have a significant impact on overall health and quality of life. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict sleep disorders based on various physiological and behavioral inputs. The model has been designed to help healthcare professionals and individuals in early detection and potential treatment plans.
