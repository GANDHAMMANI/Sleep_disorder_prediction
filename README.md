Sleep Disorder Prediction
This repository contains the code for a predictive model aimed at detecting sleep disorders using machine learning. The model has been deployed as a live web application using Streamlit, enabling users to seamlessly interact with the application and visualize predictions. The project is part of a comprehensive study aimed at improving healthcare outcomes through the early detection of sleep disorders.

Project Overview
Sleep disorders, if not detected early, can have a significant impact on overall health and quality of life. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict sleep disorders based on various physiological and behavioral inputs. The model has been designed to help healthcare professionals and individuals in early detection and potential treatment plans.

Key Features:
Machine Learning Model: Trained on a relevant dataset to predict different types of sleep disorders.
Streamlit Web Application: A user-friendly interface to input data and visualize the predictions in real-time.
Data Visualization: Displays important metrics and predictions in an intuitive manner for better understanding.
Research Contribution: This work has been published in the 7th International Conference on Innovative Computing and Communication (ICICC) 2024, Springer LNNS series, which is indexed by Scopus.
